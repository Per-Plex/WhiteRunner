# WhiteRunner
White Runner is a bot that collects grey items from the templar side story quest. It then salvages these grey items giving the player grey materials for use in crafting, enchanting, or upgrading items.

# Status (07/11/2017)
The bot is now able to loop through the entire quest and click on all armor and weapon racks. Here is a demo of the current bot in action <https://youtu.be/dVl1FAZkDK4>. I will be adding loot picks after this.

# Usage
Simply be in the home menu when you start the bot, it will take care of the rest from there.

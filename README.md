# WhiteRunner
White Runner is a bot that collects grey/white items from the templar side story quest. It then salvages these grey items giving the player grey materials for use in crafting, enchanting, or upgrading items. White Runner makes use of image processing and memory reading. The image processing is for simple tasks such as clicking on action buttons such as the "leave game" and "ok" button presented during its runtime. While the memory reading is for more complex tasks such as the finding the chests that contain loot and the loot once its on the ground.

# Status (09/07/2017)
The bot is now able to loop through the quest and pick up all loot that is dropped. The bot uses memory reading to find the Vector3 coordinate in game then translates that to a 2d screen position. Here is an upto date video of the bot.

(For reference here is the previouse video: <https://youtu.be/dVl1FAZkDK4>)

The next step for this bot is navigation to targets and improving the image processing side.As the bot is now using memory reading I would like to emphasizes the [disclaimer](https://github.com/Per-Plex/WhiteRunner#disclaimer) at the bottom of this README.

# Usage
Simply be in the home menu when you start the bot, it will take care of the rest from there.

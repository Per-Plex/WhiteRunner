# WhiteRunner
White Runner is a bot that collects grey items from the templar side story quest. It then salvages these grey items giving the player grey materials for use in crafting, enchanting, or upgrading items.

# Usage
Simply be in the home menu when you start the bot, it will take care of the rest from there.

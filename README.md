# WhiteRunner
White Runner is a bot that collects grey/white items from the templar side story quest. It then salvages these grey items giving the player grey materials for use in crafting, enchanting, or upgrading items. White Runner makes use of image processing and memory reading. The image processing is for simple tasks such as clicking on action buttons like the "leave game" and "ok" button presented during its runtime. While the memory reading is for more complex tasks such as finding chests that contain loot and the loot once its on the ground.

# Status (09/15/2017): In-Progress
White Runner now has movement and collision detection. You can see in the video below how it handles colliding with walls, chairs, and other objects. Here is an upto date video of the bot.

(For reference here is the previouse video: <https://youtu.be/YejSuaRm38c>)

The next step for White Runner is improving the navigation between objectives. Further on I will optimize the memory reading class as it is getting over crowded. As the bot is now using memory reading I would like to emphasizes the [disclaimer](https://github.com/Per-Plex/WhiteRunner#disclaimer) at the bottom of this README.

# Usage
Simply be in the home menu when you start the bot, it will take care of the rest from there.
